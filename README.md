=====================
To create a Python-based solution for automation and AI in the travel industry, especially for invoicing and chatbot development, we need to break the task into two primary components:

    Invoicing Automation:
        We will automate the process of generating invoices based on predefined templates and customer data. This will reduce errors associated with manual invoicing.
        The solution can involve extracting data from booking systems, applying the relevant invoicing rules (tax rates, discounts, payment methods), and generating a final invoice in formats like PDF.

    Chatbot Development for Travel Agencies:
        We will create a chatbot that can answer customer queries related to booking, invoice status, and general inquiries in the travel industry.
        The chatbot will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand customer queries and provide relevant responses, such as booking details or invoice requests.

Solution Overview:

    Invoicing Automation:
        Use Python for automation.
        Use Pandas for data manipulation (e.g., customer details, booking data).
        Use ReportLab to generate PDF invoices.
        Optionally, integrate with RPA tools (like UiPath or Automation Anywhere) for more advanced automation features.

    Chatbot for Travel Agencies:
        Use Rasa for the chatbot framework, as it supports NLP and conversational AI.
        Use a simple Flask app to interact with the bot via API calls.

Python Code: Invoicing Automation

We'll create a basic invoicing system where invoices are generated from travel booking data stored in a CSV file.
Requirements:

pip install pandas reportlab

Sample Invoicing Automation Code:

import pandas as pd
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
import os

# Sample data for bookings (this could come from a database or API in a real-world application)
data = [
    {"customer_name": "John Doe", "destination": "Paris", "amount": 1200, "date": "2024-05-01", "payment_method": "Credit Card", "invoice_number": "INV001"},
    {"customer_name": "Jane Smith", "destination": "Tokyo", "amount": 1500, "date": "2024-06-10", "payment_method": "Bank Transfer", "invoice_number": "INV002"},
]

# Convert to pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def generate_invoice(customer_name, destination, amount, date, payment_method, invoice_number):
    """Generate PDF invoice for a customer"""
    invoice_filename = f'invoices/{invoice_number}.pdf'
    
    # Create PDF
    c = canvas.Canvas(invoice_filename, pagesize=letter)
    width, height = letter
    
    # Title and Customer Info
    c.setFont("Helvetica", 16)
    c.drawString(30, height - 40, f"Invoice Number: {invoice_number}")
    c.drawString(30, height - 60, f"Customer: {customer_name}")
    c.drawString(30, height - 80, f"Destination: {destination}")
    c.drawString(30, height - 100, f"Date: {date}")
    c.drawString(30, height - 120, f"Payment Method: {payment_method}")
    
    # Amount details
    c.setFont("Helvetica", 14)
    c.drawString(30, height - 160, f"Total Amount: ${amount}")
    
    # Footer
    c.setFont("Helvetica", 10)
    c.drawString(30, 40, "Thank you for choosing our travel agency for your holiday plans!")
    
    # Save the PDF
    c.save()
    print(f"Invoice saved as {invoice_filename}")

# Create invoices for all customers in the DataFrame
if not os.path.exists('invoices'):
    os.makedirs('invoices')

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    generate_invoice(row['customer_name'], row['destination'], row['amount'], row['date'], row['payment_method'], row['invoice_number'])

print("All invoices generated successfully.")

Explanation:

    Sample Data: The data is simulated here, but it could be extracted from a travel agency's booking system or a database.
    ReportLab: We use the ReportLab library to generate a PDF invoice with the customer's name, destination, payment method, amount, and other details.
    PDF Generation: Invoices are saved in the invoices/ folder with unique invoice numbers.

Output:

The above script will generate PDF invoices for each booking, saved in a folder named invoices/.
Python Code: Travel Agency Chatbot

We'll use Rasa to create a simple chatbot that can answer queries related to the travel booking and invoicing system. This chatbot can be trained to understand intents like booking status, invoice requests, and general inquiries.
Step 1: Set up Rasa

    Install Rasa:

pip install rasa

Initialize a Rasa project:

    rasa init --no-prompt

    Define Intents and Entities: Edit the data/nlu.yml file to include intents like book_trip, request_invoice, and greet.

nlu:
  - intent: greet
    examples: |
      - Hello
      - Hi there
      - Good morning

  - intent: book_trip
    examples: |
      - I want to book a trip to Paris
      - Can you book a flight for me to Tokyo?
      - I'd like to book a holiday package to London

  - intent: request_invoice
    examples: |
      - Can you show me my invoice?
      - I need the invoice for my Paris trip
      - I need to see my booking invoice

    Define Responses: Add the appropriate responses in domain.yml.

responses:
  utter_greet:
    - text: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"

  utter_book_trip:
    - text: "Sure! I can help you with booking. What destination would you like to go to?"

  utter_request_invoice:
    - text: "Sure! I can help you with your invoice. Please provide your booking ID or name."

    Train the Rasa Model:

rasa train

Run the Rasa Server:

rasa run

Test the Chatbot: You can interact with the chatbot using Rasa's shell:

    rasa shell

Combining Invoicing and Chatbot

To combine invoicing automation with the chatbot, you can define a custom action in actions.py that fetches an invoice based on the user's input.

from rasa_sdk import Action
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
import os

class ActionRequestInvoice(Action):
    def name(self):
        return "action_request_invoice"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
        customer_name = tracker.get_slot('customer_name')
        invoice_number = tracker.get_slot('invoice_number')
        
        if customer_name and invoice_number:
            # Generate the invoice or fetch it from the system
            invoice_filename = f'invoices/{invoice_number}.pdf'
            if os.path.exists(invoice_filename):
                dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Your invoice is ready. You can download it here: {invoice_filename}")
            else:
                dispatcher.utter_message(text="Sorry, I couldn't find the invoice. Please check the details or try again later.")
        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="Please provide your booking details or invoice number.")
        return []

In this code:

    The chatbot can query the user for the invoice number and customer name.
    It can then either generate the invoice or fetch an existing one, returning a download link.

Deploy the Chatbot:

You can deploy the Rasa chatbot using Flask, FastAPI, or any other web framework to allow users to interact via a web interface or integrate it with an existing travel agency system.
Conclusion:

This Python-based solution automates invoicing and builds a conversational chatbot to streamline customer interactions. By combining these components, travel agencies can significantly reduce manual errors, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the customer experience
